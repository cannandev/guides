# 11. Use Cypress for e2e tests on base components

Date: 2022-08-29

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Need to ensure these base components are present and compliant with TTS Digital Council.

## Decision

Use Cypress as for e2e testing as opposed to unit tests.

## Consequences

Snapshots of changes on every build and when new content is added. RISK requires development work to add new tests, requires documentation to explain how to run tests.
