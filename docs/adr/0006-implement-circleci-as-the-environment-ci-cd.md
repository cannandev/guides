# 6. Implement CircleCI as the environment CI/CD

Date: 2022-08-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a CI/CD management to automate our DevOps pipeline. Some of the guides already use CircleCI. Digital.gov also uses it. Other options used at GSA include GitHub Actions, Jenkins, TravisCI.

## Decision

Implement CircleCI as the environment CI/CD.

## Consequences

Free. Many of the TTS developers are already familiar with it. This increases the likelihood developers will feel comfortable troubleshooting builds and optimizing pipelines.
