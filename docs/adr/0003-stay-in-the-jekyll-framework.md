# 3. Stay in the Jekyll framework

Date: 2022-08-26

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Federalist has support documentation around Jekyll.
Jekyll can support multiple “sites”
Jekyll is easier for developers to pick up than Go (Hugo) or Javascript (11ty).

## Decision

We agree to stick with Jekyll until proven otherwise (performance).

## Consequences

Future site maintenance will be familiar and well-supported.
