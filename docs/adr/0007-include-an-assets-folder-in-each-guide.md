# 7. Include an assets folder in each guide

Date: 2022-08-27

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Some pages have images and files attached. They would get lost in the top level images directory.

## Decision

Create an assets folder in each guide directory.

## Consequences

Guides maintain their unique assets. Makes it easier for a content management system to save files to a subdirectory.
